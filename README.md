# VBA Challenge #2

## 1. Overview of Project:
  The purpose of this project is to refactor already existing code to make its processing time faster and more efficent for the user. The code created before was okay for smaller data sets, but when considering very large data sets. Making the code run more efficently will make larger data sets easier to run. 

## 2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
  Initially, the analysis would take about .26 seconds to run for the 2018 data.

  The inital code had used some standard for-loops to run through the data sheets and produce the total volume as well as the return percentage. The return percentage was color coded: red was a negative return and green was a positive return.

## 3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### - What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### - How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
